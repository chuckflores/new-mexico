              <p>Unpretentious, deliciously spicy tacos served out of a food truck, eaten on paper plates in our rental car is what travel is about. The amount of meat they load into these tacos is commendable and the spice level is nothing to sneeze at. With a limited selection of toppings, the taco truck is a DIY taco joint where they give you more meat than you’ve ever seen on a taco and you try to make room for some salsa and pickled onions.  Just damn good tacos, people. These tacos were the real deal.</p>

              <p>tip: bring water or buy a mexican coke because, you know, Mexican coke!</p>

              <p>Why wouldn’t one of the best restaurants in Santa Fe be an African-Caribbean place in a strip mall? After reading lots of reviews and getting a recommendation from our friend Quincy, we decided Jambo Cafe was a must eat stop on our road trip. The food lived up to its reputation. Chef Ahmed Obo obviously loves what he does. We tasted the love and soul in the food and felt the warmth of the neighborhood as Chef Obo stopped by our table welcomed us and chatted us up about his time living in NY. </p>

              <p>We started with the Jerk Chicken Wings and enjoyed Coconut Curry Chicken and Caribbean Goat Stew. We recommend all that we ate but have a feeling you can’t really go wrong here. </p>

              <p>We split a cinnamon roll baked in a muffin tin. Chuck had the Huevos Rancheros and Rachel had a bowl of Green Chilli. Perfect for a brisk day.</p>

              <p>As coffee fans we read that Arroyo Cafe was the spot to get delicious coffee in downtown Santa Fe. We first attempted to get their famous cold brew at 8am before we headed out to Tent Rocks. That attempt was thwarted by the fact that it was 8am and the owner wouldn’t be in “until around 10am, maybe.” Our second attempt, we felt was better planned at around 11am but once again, no dice. </p>

              <p>On our third try, success! We drank cold brew espressos while the owner and and a local regular jammed on the guitar and piano. We are so happy we got to experience this cafe!</p>

Service was impeccable. When we arrived we joined the free wine tasting and hung out in the lodge for more drinks and live music. With a fireplace roaring, and feeling the effects of alcohol at high altitudes, it was the perfect quiet night after a long day of travel. Hallelujah (heard song that I love)</p>
